Explanation:

Import the necessary modules from Flask: Flask for creating the application, render_template for rendering HTML templates, request for handling data from HTTP requests, redirect for redirecting to another page, and url_for for generating URLs for endpoints.

Create an instance of the Flask application using Flask(__name__, template_folder="templates"). __name__ represents the current module, and template_folder="templates" sets the folder where the HTML templates are located.

Define the todos list, which contains the tasks. In this case, it only contains a sample task.

Define different endpoints:

/: The main page that renders the index.html template and passes the todos list to the template.

/add: The endpoint for adding a new task. It handles a POST request, retrieves the data from the form using request.form, and adds a new task to the todos list. Then, it redirects to the main page.

/edit/<int:index>: The endpoint for editing an existing task. If the request method is POST, it updates the task based on the form data and redirects to the main page. If the request method is GET, it renders the edit.html template and passes the task data and index to the template.

/check/<int:index>: The endpoint for marking a task as done or undone. It checks the validity of the index and updates the task's status in the todos list. Then, it redirects to the main page.

/delete/<int:index>: The endpoint for deleting a task from the todos list. It checks the validity of the index and removes the task from the list. Then, it redirects to the main page.

Finally, we run the application if it's being executed directly (not imported). We use app.run(debug=True) to run the server in debug mode.

The index.html template displays the list of tasks and a form for adding new tasks. For each task, it renders a checkbox for marking as done, the task text, and links for various actions (check, edit, and delete). When the checkbox state changes, the form is automatically submitted.

The edit.html template contains a form for editing an existing task. The form includes a text field displaying the current task text. After editing, the form data is submitted to the /edit/<index> endpoint.
